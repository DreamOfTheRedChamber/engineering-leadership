# What if I becomes a writer
## Phychology related?
### Motivation
My interests in phychology begins with an app called [Noom](https://www.noom.com). I am more of an indoor person and like many intellectual-challenging things such as writing. I relocated from San Mateo to Redmond in March 2017 during which I suffered a bit because it was a bit big change in terms of job, relationship and lifestyle. I also gained much weight  previously during the job hunting process. 

At that moment something is wrong with both my physical and mental health. I tried many different ways to bring myself back on track such as marathon, yoga, coaching, etc. They all changed me in one or another way and I learnt as much as I could from everything I try. 

Finally I encountered phychology which works slowly but lasts. It resonated with me so much !!! Phychology is such a subject that I want whenever I face challenging situations or changes in my life. It is also a subject that teaches me much about human nature and society. It helped me so much.
