# Intro
* Hello everyone, today I am really glad to share with you something which shocks my mind. 
* Alfred Adler had a point "All problems are interpersonal relationship problems".
* This statement might sound a bit unaccurate from technical perspective. For example, exploring space out of solar system and making humanbeings a transplanet specices is probably not an interpersonal relationship problem. 
* But I do feel a lot of challenges and even friction from interpersonal relationship. I used to arrive at office at 6:00am in the morning to be the most diligent person in the company and to be seen and praised by my manager.  For example, I feel struggled a bit talking to my parents because they always bring up the topic of marriage every time we had a phone call. 

* Two most important lessons I learnt from this book is 
  * How to build horizontal relationships instead of vertical ones
  * How to build one's happiness by the sense of contribution instead of size of contribution.

# Horizontal relationship 
## Start with a question
* Let’s start with an easily understood example, teach your child to do something or of training junior staff in the workplace, generally speaking there are two approaches that are considered: one is the method of raising by rebuke, or criticize, and the other is the method of raising by praise. 
* Which one is the better choice? To rebuke or praise? 
* When I thought about this question, of course it should be praise. 

## Is priase right approach
* For example, suppose I praised a statement you made by saying, “Good job!” Wouldn’t hearing those
words seem strange somehow? I guess it would put me in an unpleasant mood. What’s unpleasant is the feeling that from the words “Good job!” one is being talked down to. 
* The mother who praises the child by saying things
like “You’re such a good helper!” or “Good job!” is unconsciously creating a hierarchical relationship and seeing the child as beneath her. 
* Whether we praise or rebuke others, the only
diАerence is whether we are using carrot or the stick, and the background goal is manipulation, it is like training an animal. 
* Alfred Adler categorizes both praise and rebuke as symbols of a vertical relationship, not a horizontal one. 

## Correct
### From receiver's perspective
* Being a praised is always a motivation for me. From the receiver point of view, When I did something great but no one praises it, it always make me feel a little disappointed. 

* If I only motivate myself by being praised by others, I implicitly guide myself into a rabbit hole of getting happiness. To get more praise, you need to make bigger contributions. But actually happeniss comes from the sense of contribution, but the size of contribution. Just imagine a person who is disable, he might make much less contribution than someone not disabled, and receiving much less praise from others, then should he not motivate himself to do things and feel happy.
* 
* We should separate the task of how to feel happy and how to make bigger contributions.

### From giver point of view
* So concretely speaking from the giver perspective, how does one go about this? One cannot praise, and one cannot rebuke. What other words and choices are there?
* The answer is really simple, we could always start "Thank u" and acknowledge the impact someone has made. By saying thank you, you are actually saying that someone is beneficial to the community and help others build a true sense of one's worth. 

# Answer
* This mindset does help me a lot. 
* In case of my family, having the mindset of horizontal relationship helps me to deal with it a lot because I no longer try to change myself to be agreed by my parents. I understand that even they don't praise me, even complains about me, that's a problem for me. I don't want to be disagreed or disliked, but how they interpret my behaviors are their life topics, not my life topic. 
* In case of my job, it also helps me focus on making bigger impact rather than easily turned into some personal mood. If I make some huge efforts, arriving in the office at 6:00am in the morning and my manager never praises that, that's totally fine because our common goal is how to make contribution to the team, company and community. 
* In a word, this book, or individual phychology, it teaches me how to build horizontal instead of vertical relationships, and how to gain happiness from the sense of contribution, rather than the size of contribution.
