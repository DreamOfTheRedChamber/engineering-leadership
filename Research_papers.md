## Video denoising
* Most state-of-the-art video-denoising algorithms assume an additive noise model, but such a model does not often reﬂect true conditions experienced in practice. In this paper, two main issues are addressed, namely, segmentation-based block matching and estima-tion of noise level. Unlike previously reported block-matching methods, the present method uses an efﬁcient algorithm to perform block matching in spatially consistent seg-mentations of each image frame. To estimate the noise level function (NLF), which describes the noise level as a function of image brightness, a fast bilateral-median-ﬁlter-based method is proposed herein. Under the assumption of short-term coherence, this method of estimation is extended from a single frame to multiple frames. Coupling these two techniques together creates a segmentation-based, customised BM3D method that can be used to remove coloured multiplicative noise from videos

## Underwater imaging
* we address the challeng-ing problem of underwater stereo image enhancement. A new underwater imaging model is proposed and it can better de-scribe the degradation of underwater images including color distortion and contrast attenuation. In addition, a novel ob-servation that the intensity of the water part within the image is mainly contributed by the scattering light is also proposed. Coupling the proposed model and prior together, the param-eters of scattering light can be estimated. Then an iterative approach to process stereo matching and stereo image en-hancement alternatively is presented, which can signiﬁcantly improve the quality of the images and depth maps
