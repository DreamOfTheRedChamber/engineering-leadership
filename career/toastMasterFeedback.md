# Concise communication
1. Good structure and gestureFor the last point “now what” you may want to give an example of breaking “now what” into 3 points

Like the opening, personal story (small talk vs. conciseness with manager)Why slide is very clear with focus on bi-directional (allowing other to talk)Really like your framework: What, so what (implication) , now what (AIs)Great example of Sean Pean: “if you don’t vote, you don’t matter”. Reminded me “if you are not at the desk, you are on the menu” type of concise strong messageGood Flow: e.g. at this point you are talking about Meaning vs. detailsSo what slide (power of 3), would nice to have another example (because now the bar is higher, I as an audience want to hear another example here)Nice ending as well. Overall very nice, maybe slow it down even a bit more between slide to have audience digest/think

Great presentation, thank you for putting this together. Really like the way you delivered. Maybe adding an example of what, now what, so what can help. Overall it’s a great presentation, like the pictures and the flow. Great job!
